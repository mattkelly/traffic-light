This is a simple traffic light system with two lights used to demonstrate
fault tolerant design using Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR).

Target platform: Spartan-3E

*Important: equivalent_register_removal must be turned off in the Xilinx synthesis 
properties in order to avoid trimming of the redundant modules.
